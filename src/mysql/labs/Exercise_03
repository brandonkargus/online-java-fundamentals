*  MySQL Exercise 3:
*
*   Now that you have your air travel database all set up and populated, please demonstrate how to:
*
*       1.) Query all flights on a specific day
        SELECT * FROM temp.flights WHERE departure = 20211210;

*       2.) Query all flights between two specific cities on a specific day
        SELECT * FROM temp.flights WHERE departure_airport = 2 AND arrival_airport = 1 AND departure = 20211210;
*
        3.) Query all passengers on a specific flight between two specific cities today
        SELECT * FROM passengers p JOIN flights_passengers fp JOIN flights f ON p.id = fp.passenger_id AND f.departure = 20211209;

*       4.) Query the flight information for a specific passenger on a specific flight
        SELECT * FROM flights f JOIN flights_passengers fp WHERE fp.passenger_id = 1 AND fp.flight_id = 1 AND f.departure = 20211220;

*       5.) Query the passenger information for a specific user on a specific flight yesterday
        SELECT * FROM passengers p JOIN flights_passengers fp JOIN flights f WHERE fp.passenger_id = 3 AND fp.flight_id = 3 AND f.departure = 20211208;
*
        6.) Query the number of flights between two specific cities this week, month, and year
        SELECT count(*) FROM flights f WHERE departure BETWEEN 20211209 AND 20211217;
        SELECT count(*) FROM flights f WHERE departure BETWEEN 20211209 AND 20220109;
        SELECT count(*) FROM flights f WHERE departure BETWEEN 20211209 AND 20221209;


*       7.) Query the number of passengers that travelled between two specific cities today, this week, month and year
        SELECT count(*) FROM passengers p JOIN flights f WHERE departure = 20211209 AND f.departure_airport = 2 AND f.arrival_airport = 1;
        SELECT count(*) FROM passengers p JOIN flights f WHERE departure BETWEEN 20211209 AND 20211217 AND f.departure_airport = 2 AND f.arrival_airport = 1;
        SELECT count(*) FROM passengers p JOIN flights f WHERE departure BETWEEN 20211209 AND 20220109 AND f.departure_airport = 2 AND f.arrival_airport = 1;
        SELECT count(*) FROM passengers p JOIN flights f WHERE departure BETWEEN 20211209 AND 20221209 AND f.departure_airport = 2 AND f.arrival_airport = 1;


*       8.) Insert records for new flights between airports
        INSERT INTO `temp`.`flights` (`airline`, `plane`, `departure_airport`, `departure`, `arrival_airport`, `arrival`) VALUES ('1', '1', '3', '2022-1-07', '1', '2022-1-08');

*       9.) Insert records for new tickets and passengers on specific flights
        INSERT INTO `temp`.`flights_passengers` (`flight_id`, `passenger_id`) VALUES ('1', '10');
        INSERT INTO `temp`.`flights_passengers` (`flight_id`, `passenger_id`) VALUES ('2', '10');


*       10.) Update meal preference (or something similar) for a specific passenger on a specific flight
        UPDATE `temp`.`passengers` SET `ticket_info` = '(RT) MSP to SAL - $953.69 - First Class - Seat 2A (MSP-SAL), First Class - Seat 3D (SAL-MSP)' WHERE (`id` = '10');

*       Bonus: Have some fun - get creative - what else can you do? Flex those SQL muscles and show us what
*           you've got! :)
